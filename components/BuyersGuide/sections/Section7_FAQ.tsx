            question: "How long does a typical installation take?",
            answer: "Most of our church installations are completed in 1-2 days, and in many cases, we're in and out within a single day. We know your Sunday schedule is sacred, so we work around itâ€”scheduling installations during weekdays or off-hours to ensure zero disruption to your worship services. Our efficient, certified teams handle everything from rigging to calibration, so you can focus on your ministry while we transform your space."
        },
        {
            question: "What kind of warranty is included?",
            answer: "We stand behind our work with a comprehensive 5-year parts and labor warranty. This is superior to the industry standard of 2-3 years with limited coverage, giving you complete peace of mind."
        },
        {
            question: "Can an LED screen be installed in our specific venue?",
            answer: "Absolutely. Our solutions are highly customizable. The process begins with a detailed Site Assessment where our engineers map out a technical plan for a perfect, seamless fit in your unique space, regardless of size or architectural challenges."
        },
        {
            question: "How difficult is it to operate the screen?",
            answer: `We prioritize user-friendly systems. Our screens integrate perfectly with software like ProPresenter, which is standard in the ${sector === 'church' ? 'worship' : 'events'} world. We provide full training to ensure your team feels confident and empowered.`
        },
        {
            question: "Is financing available?",
            answer: "Yes, we offer flexible financing and leasing options to make your vision a reality. We work with you to find a financial solution that fits your budget and helps you realize the long-term value of your investment."
